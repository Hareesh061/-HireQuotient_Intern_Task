Note: (I am done how much possible in the given time line.)
As part of the task I need to complete any one Assignment/Task based on my interests.

**Assignment 1 (More on website design & development):**
We would like to clone the homepage of any of these websites:
https://managewise.framer.website/
https://www.notion.so/
https://culture-breathe-337021.framer.app/


**Assignment 2 (More on web-app frontend development):**
https://dark-shield-55e.notion.site/Admin-Dashboard-3bc214bb876e4453ae3cd23288548689

I choose the second assignment 2, which is more on web-app frontend development:

The key points of the code are given below:

Certainly! Here are some improvements and optimizations you can consider:

1. **Separate Components:**
   Break down the code into smaller, reusable components. For example, create separate components for the user table, user row, and pagination. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

2. **State Management:**
   Consider using a state management library like Redux for better state control, especially if the application is expected to grow in complexity.

3. **Loading State:**
   Add a loading state to handle the period when data is being fetched. This provides better feedback to users.

4. **Error Handling:**
   Implement error handling for the data fetching process. Display an error message or retry option if the data fetching fails.

5. **API Endpoint as a Variable:**
   Instead of hardcoding the API endpoint, make it a variable or a configuration constant. This makes it easier to change in the future.

6. **Loading Data on Demand:**
   Consider fetching data only when it's needed, rather than on component mount, to optimize performance.

7. **CSS Styling:**
   Improve the styling by organizing the CSS in a more modular and maintainable way. Consider using CSS-in-JS libraries or preprocessors for better styling practices.

8. **Confirmation Modal:**
   Use a custom confirmation modal for both row deletion and bulk deletion for a more polished user experience.

9. **Sorting:**
   Add the ability to sort the user data based on different columns (e.g., name, email, role).

10. **Backend Validation:**
    If possible, add validation on the backend for user data edits to ensure data consistency.

11. **Accessibility:**
    Ensure that the application is accessible by providing appropriate ARIA attributes and testing with accessibility tools.

12. **Code Comments:**
    Add comments to explain complex logic or any non-trivial implementation details.

13. **Error Boundary:**
    Implement an error boundary at the top level of the component tree to catch and handle errors gracefully.

14. **PropTypes:**
    Use PropTypes to document the expected types of props for each component.

15. **Testing:**
    Write unit tests for critical functions and components using testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library.
